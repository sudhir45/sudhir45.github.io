	"You don't stop attacks, you limit blast radius.",
	"Every manual process is an eventual outage or breach.",
	"Defense fails first where ownership is unclear.",
	"A quiet network is often more dangerous than a noisy one.",

	"If engineers hate it, attackers will love it.",
	"Defense without context is just guesswork.",
	"Attack paths are rarely complex, just overlooked.",
	"Security fails at integration points, not components.",
	"If detection comes after damage, it's just reporting.",
	"Assumed breach is not pessimism, it's realism.",
	"Over-restrictive controls create shadow systems.",
	"Most security failures are design failures, not exploit failures.",
	"Visibility without action is theater.",
	"If it can't be tested, it can't be trusted.",
	"The strongest control is the one that removes an entire class of bugs.",
	"Manual reviews don't scale, automated mistakes do.",

	"The goal is not fewer alerts, it's fewer surprises.",
	"If a system can't fail safely, it will fail dangerously.",
	"Real security is boring, until it suddenly matters.",
