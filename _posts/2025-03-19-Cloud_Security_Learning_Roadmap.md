A multi-cloud security roadmap starts with strong cloud fundamentals and builds to advanced topics like IAM, monitoring, encryption, and incident response. It’s crucial to begin by understanding each provider’s **Shared Responsibility Model** – e.g. AWS notes “Security and Compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer” – meaning providers secure the cloud infrastructure while users secure their data and configurations.
